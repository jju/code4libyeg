## Join Us

The YEG chapter of Code4Lib aims to bring together library folks from Edmonton and the surrounding area for discussion, sharing, events and professional development opportunities.

We do this by holding and promoting opportunities related to programming, coding, making, hacking, design, open data.... basically we're interested in all things that can have code under the hood.

Follow along by joining our [Google Groups mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/code4lib-edmonton).
